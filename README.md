# vue-date-range-picker
A vue component using Bootstrap 4 styles for date range selection

![Vue-Treeselect Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owumaro/vue-date-range-picker/master/screenshot.png)

This component was inspired by:
- Google Analytics date range picker
- https://github.com/dangrossman/daterangepicker

This component was built because the first one isn't open-sourced, and the second one doesn't provide the compare feature and is a jquery plugin.

This component relies on Bootstrap 4 CSS styles. If you want to use this project without bootstrap 4, you will have a lot of CSS to copy from Bootstrap 4.

This component provides only the date range selection feature. You have to make the work to include the component in a modal, or in a popover triggered by a nice button.

This component is still a work in progress...
